# CS231n-Assignmen-Solution
Solutions for the first assignment of Standford's free CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

## Assignment 1
---
Implementations of linear classifiers (Softmax, KNN, SVM) and a two layer preceptron which utilises PCA and numerous optimisation functions (Momentum, AdaGrad, RMSprop and Adam)

## Assignment 2
---
Thus far...

1. A fully connected neural network model with dropout, batchnorm/layernorm and further optimisation algorythms
2. A convolutional neural network model with implementations for convolutional layers and maxPool layers
